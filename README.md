This project introduces a system that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, specifically BERT embeddings and doc2vec, to quantify the similarity between a candidateâ€™s resume and a job description. Key features include a certification check to validate candidate qualifications, automated email notifications to keep candidates informed, and a machine learning model that trains on cosine similarity scores to improve matching accuracy over time. Additionally, a feedback form via Google Forms enables employers to provide insights, further refining the system. Deployed through a user-friendly Streamlit interface, the tool allows employers to quickly assess and rank candidate resumes against job descriptions, optimizing the recruitment process and efficiently identifying the most suitable candidates. This comprehensive approach enhances the hiring process, ensuring a better fit for job roles.
